This directory contains a bootable 4-meg hard disk image and a .bochsrc file.
To start up Linux, you should be able to simply cd into this directory and
run bochs.

The bootable disk image was created using the following method:
1. make 4-meg empty file using dd if=/dev/zero...
2. run mke2fs to create a filesystem
3. mount the filesystem using loopback
4. copy contents of a redhat rescue disk into empty filesystem, and
   copy a kernel into /boot.  unmount.
5. boot bochs once using a LILO floppy, root=/dev/hda.
6. within bochs, set up lilo.conf to make /dev/hda bootable, run lilo to
   make the hard disk image bootable
7. now boot hard disk image, floppy no longer needed.

If it is working, you will see "LILO boot:" followed by boot messages.
At the end, you see:

    This is the Red Hat rescue disk. Most of the basic system commands are 
    in /bin.

    Type exit to halt the system.

    # _

Poke around a bit to test it.  I'll include more diagnostics some day.
When you're done, type "exit" and then turn off the power.
